# Crop field detection using graph-based image segmentation and contrastive learning

## Abstract

As the world population grows, the motivation to ensure enough food for everyone has
brought a diversity of technologies from other industries to agriculture. The main challenge is
producing more food with fewer resources using a collection of techniques known as precision
agriculture. In precision agriculture, drawing crop field boundaries is an essential practice,
and it allows the farmer to evaluate operating performance separately and compare different
seed varieties, pesticides, and fertilizers. However, manually drawing field boundaries is often
a time-consuming task. In this context, we propose a method to detect crop fields automatically 
and infer their boundaries by applying graph-based image segmentation combined with
contrastive learning, an approach that achieves comparable performance to supervised deep
learning methods but without requiring a massive amount of labeled samples.
